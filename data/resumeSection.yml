  ## FAQs

  ### How do I book an appointment? 
  
  Please click the Book Now button which will redirect you to our outside booking platform. This platform is also used to rebook or cancel appointments and to connect you to your virtual appointment. 

  ### Can I come in-person to your office? 

  Sorry, at this time CCMHC only offers online virtual appointments. 

  ### Can I request phone-only appointments? 

  At this time CCMHC only offers **video-based appointments**.  This is done, in part, to engage with our clients and to assess their well-being.

  ### Can another individual(s) join my appointment? 
  Generally, no – your individual appointment is intended for you alone. (CCMHC does not book group mental health appointments such as family appointments or a couple appointments.)  On rare occasions another individual, such as a social worker, may be invited into the appointment with prior client consent and pre-arranged with CCMHC.  For regular appointments, we request clients avoid spaces with ongoing background noise (to promote easy communication) or with family members or other individuals in the same room or in hearing/ visual range (to avoid privacy concerns).  Aim for a quiet private space so you can get the most out of your appointment.

  ### What technology do I need for my virtual appointment? 

  You will need access to a phone, computer, or tablet with the ability to make video and audio calls. 

  ### What if I need to cancel my appointment?
  
  If you need to cancel or rebook your appointment please do so at least 24 hours prior to your appointment. Please click on the Book Now button to cancel or rebook. If you cancel **within** 24 hours of your appointment time you will be charged for a missed appointment.

  ### Will you be my primary care provider?
  
  CCMHC does not provide primary care services or act as your GP. If you need help finding a primary care provider, please see the Mental Health Resources page which has information on getting connected to a GP.

  ### Will you manage my inpatient psychiatric care?
  
  CCMHC’s services are directed to clients with lower/ moderate mental health needs. We do not offer inpatient care. 

  ### Are CCMHC services covered under OHIP (in Ontario) or MSP (in British Columbia)? 
  
  Unfortunately, they are not. Currently CCMHC services are private or “out of pocket.”   After payment you will receive a receipt. You may discuss with your extended health insurance plan if our services are covered. If you have a plan with a health care spending account or a wellness benefit, you may be able to be reimbursed. Please discuss with your insurance provider directly.

  ### Are your services confidential? 
  
  Yes, we maintain client/provider confidentiality. However, there are exceptions under which CCMHC may be obligated to disclose your personal information. These include but are not limited to the following:         
  (1) concern you pose a serious risk to yourself or a serious imminent risk to another   
  (2) you disclose a child is being abused/at risk of harm  
  (3) you disclose that a health professional sexually abused or sexually harassed you  
  (4) If court ordered to release a client file.  

  ### Can I schedule an appointment when I am out of town?

  If you can secure a private, quiet space with appropriate technology/ internet bandwidth, you are welcome to keep your virtual appointment as long as the following requirement is met: **you must be physically located in one of the following provinces: Ontario or British Columbia**.  If you are located elsewhere, such as out of country, please let CCMHC know and we will re-book your appointment  - as appropriate - for when you are back.
